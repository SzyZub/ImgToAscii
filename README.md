Description:

To use the program you need to place a jpg file with a name "image" in the ImageFolder folder just as already done. 

You use the program with your mouse.

When the initial image has big dimensions, it can take a while for program to process it(it does it at the beginning of the program, before menu is shown)

Max dimensions of a shown image in ascii are 120x90 px (program should resize it correctly automatically)

Personally I prefer the dark mode over the light mode since it tends to create better view.

The program will make a txt file with ascii art of the image when exiting the program. It uses the colorless and light combination to decide which characters to put.
